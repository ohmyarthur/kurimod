## v3.2.0 - January 19, 2025

### Major Updates

This release brings significant improvements to kurimod's async support and non-blocking behavior, making it fully compatible with Kurigram.

### New Features

- **Full Async Support**: Complete async/await implementation throughout the codebase
- **Non-blocking Callback Execution**: Sync callbacks now run in executor to prevent event loop blocking
- **Async Methods in Chat and User**: All `listen()`, `ask()`, and `stop_listening()` methods are now fully async

### Changes

- Replaced deprecated `asyncio.get_event_loop()` with `asyncio.get_running_loop()`
- Modified patch mechanism to preserve async methods instead of converting them to sync
- Updated base library from Pyrogram to Kurigram
- Updated all documentation to reference Kurigram instead of Pyrogram

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed critical bug where sync callbacks were blocking the event loop
- Fixed bug where Chat and User methods were sync but called async client methods
- Fixed incorrect inheritance in Client class (was inheriting from decorator result)

### Distribution Changes

- Removed PyPI distribution - now GitHub-only
- Updated installation instructions to use `git+https://github.com/ohmyarthur/kurimod`
- Updated documentation deployment to GitHub Pages at https://ohmyarthur.github.io/kurimod

### Documentation

- Added comprehensive CHANGELOG.md
- Updated all documentation to reference Kurigram
- Added copyright attribution to Pyromod and Kurigram

### Credits

This project is based on:
- [Pyromod](https://github.com/usernein/pyromod) by usernein
- [Kurigram](https://github.com/KurimuzonAkuma/kurigram) by KurimuzonAkuma

### Breaking Changes

- Installation now requires using git+ URL instead of PyPI
- All Chat and User methods are now async - update your code to use `await`
- Base library changed from Pyrogram to Kurigram - update imports accordingly
