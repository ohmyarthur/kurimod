kurimod is a versatile Python add-on for the Pyrogram library, designed to make developing Telegram bots faster and more
efficient.

It's based on **monkeypatching**, which means it works together with Pyrogram, rather than being a fork or modified
version. It
adds features to Pyrogram classes on the go, so you don't need to update it every time Pyrogram is updated.

Whether you're building a simple chatbot or a complex form to get multiple responses from the user, kurimod has you
covered. It enhances Pyrogram with a range
of advanced features, simplifies conversation handling, and offers a high degree of customizability.

## Key Features

- **Effortless Bot Development:** kurimod streamlines the process of building conversational Telegram bots, saving you
  time and effort
  during development.

- **Advanced Conversation Management:** Managing conversations with users is made easier, allowing you to create dynamic
  and interactive interactions much easier, without having to save states anywhere, by leveraging the power of
  async/await syntax.

- **Effortless Inline Keyboards Creation:** Creating inline keyboards is easier than ever with kurimod's inline keyboard
  helper functions.

- **User-Friendly Pagination:** Enhance the user experience by providing easy navigation tools with the kurimod's
  pagination
  helpers.

- **Highly Customizable:** kurimod's configuration options let you customize its behavior to meet your specific project
  requirements.
