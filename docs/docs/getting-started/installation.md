To get started with kurimod, you can install it using uv:

```bash
uv add git+https://github.com/ohmyarthur/kurimod
```

Or with pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ohmyarthur/kurimod
```

Or with poetry:

```bash
poetry add git+https://github.com/ohmyarthur/kurimod
```

:::note

kurimod **requires** kurigram to be installed, since it's a plugin that only does monkeypatching, rather than a standalone fork of kurigram.
