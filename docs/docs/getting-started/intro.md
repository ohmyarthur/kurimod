kurimod is a versatile Python add-on for the Kurigram library, designed to make developing Telegram bots faster and more
efficient.

It's based on **monkeypatching**, which means it works together with Kurigram, rather than being a fork or modified
version. It
adds features to Kurigram classes on the go, so you don't need to update it every time Kurigram is updated.

Whether you're building a simple chatbot or a complex form to get multiple responses from the user, kurimod has you
covered. It enhances Kurigram with a range
of advanced features, simplifies conversation handling, and offers a high degree of customizability.

## About Kurigram

**Kurigram** is a Telegram MTProto API client library for Python that maintains **100% API compatibility with Pyrogram**. This means:

- All Pyrogram API calls work exactly the same in Kurigram
- You can use `from pyrogram import Client` with Kurigram
- All filters, types, and methods have the same names and signatures
- Existing Pyrogram code can be used with Kurigram without modifications

The main difference is that Kurigram is actively maintained by a different developer (KurimuzonAkuma) and may include additional optimizations and features while maintaining full backward compatibility with Pyrogram's API.

## Key Features

- **Effortless Bot Development:** kurimod streamlines the process of building conversational Telegram bots, saving you
  time and effort

- **Advanced Conversation Management:** Managing conversations with users is made easier, allowing you to create dynamic
  and interactive interactions much easier, without having to save states anywhere, by leveraging the power of
